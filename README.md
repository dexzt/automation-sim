# ðŸšš Automation Warehouse Simulation

This project is a 3D browser-based warehouse simulation built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), featuring animated conveyor boxes, a dynamic racking system, and a controllable forklift using keyboard input.

## ðŸ§  What is Three.js?

[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) is a powerful JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. It allows developers to build real-time 3D environments without requiring plugins, and supports features like:

- Scene management
- Lighting and shadows
- Geometries and materials
- 3D models (GLTF, OBJ)
- Animation and physics
- Camera and user controls

Three.js makes it possible to create interactive visuals like games, simulations, product previews, and immersive dashboardsâ€”all within your browser.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- **Rectangular Conveyor Loop** â€“ Boxes animate around a closed path with tray detection.
- **Customizable Forklift** â€“ Controlled via `WASD` + `Arrow` keys with vertical lift logic.
- **Expanded Racking System** â€“ Configurable vertical shelving with tray highlights.
- **Real-Time Tray Detection** â€“ Trays respond dynamically when boxes intersect.
- **Responsive UI** â€“ Bootstrap-powered controls with adjustable box count.
- **GSAP Animations** â€“ Smooth UI transitions and animation sequencing.
- **OrbitControls** â€“ User can rotate and zoom the scene freely.
